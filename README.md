# Practicum

To use this program in its current state, use the following commands:

Linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 archive.py
```

Windows:
```
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 archive.py
```

I plan to dockerize this project in the near future.

The issue of the differing internet speeds has been solved with Semaphore object.
